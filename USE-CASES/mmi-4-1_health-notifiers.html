<h2 id="mmi-4-1_health-notifiers-target users">Target Users:</h2>

&lt;List all users that are involved in the use case, e.g. device manufacturer, gateway manufacturer, cloud provider&gt;
<br><br>
End user with a health problem they wish to monitor.
<br><br>
Health services provider (doctor, nurse, paramedic, etc).

<h2 id="mmi-4-1_health-notifiers-motivation">Motivation:</h2>

In critical situations regarding health,
like a medical emergency,
media multimodality may be the most effective way to communicate alerts,
When the goal is to monitor the health evolution of a
person in both emergency and non-emergency contexts,
access via networked devices may be the most effective way to collect data and 
monitor a patient's status.

<h2 id="mmi-4-1_health-notifiers-expected devices">Expected Devices:</h2>

Medical facilities supporting device and service access.

<h2 id="mmi-4-1_health-notifiers-expected data">Expected Data:</h2>

Command and status information transferred between the personal mobile device
application and the meeting space's services and devices.
<br><br>
Profile data for user preferences.

<h2 id="mmi-4-1_health-notifiers-dependencies">Dependencies:</h2>

<li>WoT Discovery</li>
<li>Optional: WoT Scripting API in application on mobile personal device and possibly
  in IoT orchestration services.</li>

<h2 id="mmi-4-1_health-notifiers-description">Description:</h2>

In medical facilities,
a system may provide multiple options to control sensor operations
by voice or gesture ("start reading my blood pressure now").
These interactions may be mediated by an application installed into a smartphone.
The system integrates information from multiple sensors
(for example, blood pressure and heart rate);
reports medical sensor readings periodically (for example, to a remote medical facility)
and sends alerts when unusual readings/events are detected.

<h3 id="mmi-4-1_health-notifiers-variants">Variants:</h3>

The user may have additional mobile devices they want to incorporate into
an interaction, for example a headset acting as an auditory aid or personal speech output
device.

<h2 id="mmi-4-1_health-notifiers-gaps">Gaps:</h2>

Data format describing user interface preferences.

Ability to install applications based on links that can access IoT services.

<h2 id="mmi-4-1_health-notifiers-existing standards">Existing standards:</h2>

This use case is based on MMI UC 3.2.

<h2 id="mmi-4-1_health-notifiers-comments">Comments:</h2>
