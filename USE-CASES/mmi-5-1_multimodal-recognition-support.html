<h2 id="mmi-5-1_multimodal-recognition-support-motivation">Motivation:</h2>

Recognizer system development has arrived at a point of maturity where
if we want to dramatically enhance recognition performance,
sensor fusion from multiple modalities is needed.
In order to achieve this,
an image recognizer should incorporate results coming from other 
kinds of recognizers (e.g. audio recognizer) within the network
engaged in the same interaction cycle.

<h2 id="mmi-5-1_multimodal-recognition-support-expected devices">Expected Devices:</h2>

Audio sensing device (microphone).

Video sensing device (camera).

Audio recognition service.

Video recognition service.

Devices capabale of presenting alerts in various modalities.

<h2 id="mmi-5-1_multimodal-recognition-support-expected data">Expected Data:</h2>

Command and status information transferred between the sensing devices,
the recognition services, and the alert devices.

Profile data for user preferences.

<h2 id="mmi-5-1_multimodal-recognition-support-description">Description:</h2>

An audio recognizer has been trained with the more common sounds in the house,
in order to provide alerts in case of an emergency.
In the same house a security system uses a video recognizer to identify people
at the front door.
These two systems need to cooperate with a remote home management system
to provide integrated services.
