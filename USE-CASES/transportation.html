<h2 id="transportation-target users">Target Users:</h2>

Smart Cities: managing roads, public transport and commuting, autonomous and human driven vehicles, transportation tracking and control systems, route information systems, commuting and public transport, vehicles, on-demand transportation, self driving fleets, vehicle information and control systems, infrastructure sharing and payment system, smart parking, smart vehicle servicing, emergency monitoring, etc.

Transport companies: managing shipping, air cargo, train cargo and last mile delivery transportation systems including automated systems.

Commuters: Mobility as a service, booking systems, route planning, ride sharing, self-driving, self-servicing infrastructure, etc.


<h2 id="transportation-motivation">Motivation:</h2>

Provide common vocabulary for describing transport related services and solutions that can be reused across sub-categories, for easier interoperability between various systems owned by different stakeholders.

Thing Description templates could be defined in many subdomains to help integration or interworking between multiple systems.

Transportation of goods can be optimized at global level by enhancing interoperability between vertical systems.

<h2 id="transportation-expected devices">Expected Devices:</h2>

Road information system (routes, conditions, navigation).
Road control system (e.g. virtual rails).
Traffic management services, e.g. intelligent traffic light system with localization and identification (by satellite, radio frequency identification, cameras etc).
Emergency monitoring and data/location sharing.
Airport management.
Shipping docks and ports management.
Train networks management.
Public transport vehicles (train, metro, tram, bus, minibus), mobility as a service (ride sharing, bicycle sharing, scooters etc).
Transportation network planning and management (hubs, backbones, sub-networks, last mile network).
Electronic timetable management system.
Vehicles (human driven, self-driving, isolated or part of fleet).
Connected vehicles (cars, ships, airplanes, trains, buses etc).

<h2 id="transportation-expected data">Expected Data:</h2>

Vehicle data (identification, location, speed, route, selected vehicle data).
Weather and climate data.
Contextual data (representing various risk factors, delays, etc).

<h2 id="transportation-dependencies">Dependencies:</h2>

Localization technologies.
Automotive data.
Contextual data.
Cloud integration.

<h2 id="transportation-description">Description:</h2>

Transportation system implementers will be able to use a unified data description model accoss various systems.

<h3 id="transportation-variants">Variants:</h3>

There will be different verticals, such as:

<ul>
<li>Smart City public transport</li>
<li>Smart City traffic management</li>
<li>Smart city vehicle management</li>
<li>Cargo traffic management</li>
<li>Cargo vehicle management</li>
</ul>
